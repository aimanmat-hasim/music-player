# Music Player 🎙️

A Spotify-like music player built with React and TypeScript, designed to play my top 5 favorite songs.  
This project focuses on clean UI, smooth audio interaction, and a glassmorphism-inspired design.

## Technologies ⌨️
- `React 19`
- `Vite 7`
- `TypeScript`

## Features 🚀
- **Audio Playback** — Play / Pause and Next / Previous track navigation
- **Playlist Support** — Automatically switches to the next track when a song ends
- **Progress & Timing Control** — Displays current time and total duration with an interactive seek bar
- **Shuffle & Repeat** — Shuffle playback and multiple repeat modes
- **Glassmorphism UI** — Frosted glass surface with background blur, subtle transparency, and soft shadows

## The Process 🛣️
This project documents my learning journey in building an interactive music player.  
Development is planned and tracked using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, focusing on clear architecture, incremental progress, and thoughtful design decisions.
